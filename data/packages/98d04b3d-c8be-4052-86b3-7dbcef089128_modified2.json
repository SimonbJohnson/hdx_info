Proper nutrition, safe feeding practices, quality care and interaction are all critical to ensuring that children\u2019s brains and bodies have, and are able to utilize, all the nutrients that they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nHolt International's Child Nutrition Program (CNP) addresses the critical nutrition, health and development issues facing orphaned and vulnerable children around the world. CNP focuses on addressing the unique nutrition and feeding needs of children who are most at risk of malnutrition. This program uses a Training of Trainers (ToT) approach to empower sites to provide optimal care to children.  CNP\u2019s training, tools, resources and support provides sites with targeted interventions to help address and prevent the causes of malnutrition, especially in children ages 0-5 and children with disabilities. \n\nCNP provides partnering sites individualized resources and tools to support behavioral and organizational change through a variety of methods consisting of training and hands on practicum. This program\u2019s training covers a range of topics and health interventions including: nutrition basics, nutrition by age, hygiene and sanitation, growth tracking, health monitoring, nutrition interventions to address malnutrition and other common illnesses, feeding and positioning, food texture modification, and child development. CNP also provides sites with Holt\u2019s online Nutrition Screening System Database. This database is an essential tool that enables sites to track and evaluate the health and growth of children and also address any health related issues early and effectively. \n\nThrough CNP\u2019s standardized training, long term supported implementation and rigorous evaluation, the program is able to implement a sustainable and scalable model. Local trained trainers are successfully able to scale the program to additional sites and provide ongoing support.\n\nSince the beginning of the program in 2013, the Child Nutrition Program has:\n\u2022\tConducted more than 20,000 health and nutrition screenings, impacting more than 4,700 children while allowing for optimal health monitoring and intervention.

Proper nutrition, safe feeding practices, quality care and interaction are all critical to ensuring that children\u2019s brains and bodies have, and are able to utilize, all the nutrients that they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nHolt International's Child Nutrition Program (CNP) addresses the critical nutrition, health and development issues facing orphaned and vulnerable children around the world. CNP focuses on addressing the unique nutrition and feeding needs of children who are most at risk of malnutrition. This program uses a Training of Trainers (ToT) approach to empower sites to provide optimal care to children.  CNP\u2019s training, tools, resources and support provides sites with targeted interventions to help address and prevent the causes of malnutrition, especially in children ages 0-5 and children with disabilities. \n\nCNP provides partnering sites individualized resources and tools to support behavioral and organizational change through a variety of methods consisting of training and hands on practicum. This program\u2019s training covers a range of topics and health interventions including: nutrition basics, nutrition by age, hygiene and sanitation, growth tracking, health monitoring, nutrition interventions to address malnutrition and other common illnesses, feeding and positioning, food texture modification, and child development. CNP also provides sites with Holt\u2019s online Nutrition Screening System Database. This database is an essential tool that enables sites to track and evaluate the health and growth of children and also address any health related issues early and effectively. \n\nThrough CNP\u2019s standardized training, long term supported implementation and rigorous evaluation, the program is able to implement a sustainable and scalable model. Local trained trainers are successfully able to scale the program to additional sites and provide ongoing support.\n\nSince the beginning of the program in 2013, the Child Nutrition Program has:\n\u2022\tConducted more than 20,000 health and nutrition screenings, impacting more than 4,700 children while allowing for optimal health monitoring and intervention. More than 30% of the children impacted by the program have a disability or special need. 70.2% of the children start the program with one or more malnutrition indicators (stunting, wasting, underweight, anemia)\n\u2022\tTrained more than 1,000 people on key principles of the Child Nutrition Program.\n\u2022\tExpanded to 7 different countries and 41 sites including institutional care, day care, and foster care programs. \n\u2022\tConducted, and continuing, research and statistical analysis to provide evidence of program impact and areas to improve practices.\n", 0], ["Goal\nThe overall goal of the Marawi Response Project is to increase opportunities for individuals and\ncommunities affected by the Marawi siege to actively contribute to advancing durable solutions in a manner that reduces the threat of violent extremism.

Strengthened community cohesion in communities hosting large numbers of IDPs.\n\nBoth of these Intermediate Results are inter-related, and will be accomplished using a community-based, participatory approach.\n\nPurpose and Relationship to Mission Objectives\nThis project contributes to the following USAID/Philippines Country Development Cooperation\nStrategy Development Objective:\n\nDevelopment Objective 2: Improved peace and stability in conflict-affected areas, particularly in\nMindanao\n\nWithin this framework, USAID/Philippines crafted a medium-term, strategic implementation plan to guide the Mission\u2019s Marawi response. The plan\u2019s goal is to support the reintegration or return of IDPs through 2020, particularly those IDPs for whom the likelihood of returning to Marawi seems unlikely for the foreseeable future.\n\nTo achieve the goal, the plan establishes three objectives:\nObjective 1: Address the early recovery needs of individuals displaced by the Marawi conflict; Objective 2: Transition IDPs to social and economic stability; and\nObjective 3: Establish the conditions for local governments and communities in and around Marawi to address their long-term rehabilitation needs.\n\nThe first phase of the plan, which focuses on achieving Objectives 1 and 2, is being implemented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), USAID\u2019s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), and Food for Peace, as well as by existing USAID/Philippines projects that were able to quickly respond to the needs of Marawi IDPs.\nMost of these existing USAID/Philippines projects, however, will end by early to mid-2019.\n\n", 0], ["SAFE Seas will build off of nearly twenty years of ILAB experience fighting trafficking and child labor in the fisheries sector by helping the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines strengthen regulations and policies to address labor exploitation on fishing vessels.

In addition, parents are taught how to provide for their families through vocational and community trainings, helping them to be better farmers or small business owners, improved community members, and enhanced parents. The Child Sponsorship Program is one way that WHI invests in the lives of children in need. Our programs have been running in Sierra Leone since 1996, Indonesia and the Philippines since 1997, and in Zambia since 1999.</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">1</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0006/#activity+description/5", "type": "text", "id": "text0006"}, {"bite": "The largest <span class=\"hbheader\">sectors</span> is <span class=\"hbvalue\">Protection</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">2</span> reports followed by <span class=\"hbvalue\">Agriculture|Economic Recovery and Development|Health|Human Rights Democracy and Governance|Protection|Water Sanitation and Hygiene</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">1</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0006/#sector+list/10", "type": "text", "id": "text0006"}, {"bite": "The largest <span class=\"hbheader\">local_partners</span> is <span class=\"hbvalue\"></span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">10</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0007/#org+list+local+partner/15", "type": "text", "id": "text0007"}, {"bite": "The largest <span class=\"hbheader\">prime_awardee</span> is <span class=\"hbvalue\"></span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">10</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0007/#org+prime/16", "type": "text", "id": "text0007"}, {"bite": "The largest <span class=\"hbheader\">donors</span> is <span class=\"hbvalue\"></span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">8</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0007/#org+donor+list/26", "type": "text", "id": "text0007"}, {"bite": "The largest <span class=\"hbheader\">organization</span> is <span class=\"hbvalue\">World Hope International</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">3</span> reports followed by <span class=\"hbvalue\">World Vision US, Inc.</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">2</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0008/#org+implementing+name/0", "type": "text", "id": "text0008"}, {"bite": "<span class=\"hbheader\">target_project_reach</span>:<span class=\"hbvalue\">6548</span>", "priority": 8, "subtype": "topline figure", "uniqueID": "text0012/#targeted+num/17", "type": "text", "id": "text0012"}, {"bite": "<span class=\"hbheader\">actual_project_reach</span>:<span class=\"hbvalue\">0</span>", "priority": 8, "subtype": "topline figure", "uniqueID": "text0012/#reached+num/18", "type": "text", "id": "text0012"}, {"bite": "<span class=\"hbheader\">target_groups</span>:<span class=\"hbvalue\">0</span>", "priority": 8, "subtype": "topline figure", "uniqueID": "text0012/#targeted+description/20", "type": "text", "id": "text0012"}]}}, "hxl": 1}]}
