But rainfall has decreased and farmers are seeking other forms of income generation. Therefore, we will work to increase farmers\u2019 income through more productive and sustainable agriculture systems like irrigation and poultry and livestock raising.\nDrought, deforestation, and poverty have left farmers and their families facing food shortages for up to six months every year. We will partner with the World Food Program and UNICEF to create a food for work program. Residents will build and repair roads and water pipes, and be paid with food for their families.\nMany children under five years old do not have access to a balanced diet. Therefore we will focus on nutrition education for families, emphasizing the importance of protein and vegetables for children during their early years.\nChildren in remote areas often miss out on immunizations because there are not enough healthcare workers to travel to these hard-to-reach places. So we will train additional community health volunteers who will be able to serve these children and families.\nFamilies need education about malaria prevention and treatment. We plan to strengthen healthcare education at the household level, where knowledge is lacking.\nWater is scarce in the area, and people depend on streams for drinking water and irrigation. However, these streams dry up after the rainy season, and children have to travel up to three miles to find water. We will focus on creating additional water sources that provide children with this essential resource.\nDiarrhea and acute respiratory infections are prevalent for children under five because of unsafe water and poor hygiene. Very few families have a latrine. We will concentrate on training children and adults about personal hygiene, and will work to improve sanitation in the village.\nChildren stop attending school after the primary level because middle and secondary schools are too far from the community. We will work with the Education Department to provide transportation and funding so students can continue their schooling.\nStudents who drop out of school are more likely to become involved in dangerous and antisocial activities. Therefore, we will provide vocational skills training for youth so they can find employment and earn income.\nAlthough many parents recognize the importance of early childhood education, there are no preschools in the area and young children are therefore not prepared for primary school. So we will open preschools, provide supplies and teaching aids, and train teachers and management committees.\nSeveral parents are not educated and do not see the benefits of education for their children in terms of income and livelihood. We will work with the active local Parent Teacher Association (PTA) as they spread the word to others about the importance of education.\nDuring the rainy season, landslides can quickly wipe out farmers' fields, which are planted on steep hillsides. These landslides cause families to lose their access to food and income, which affects the well-being of children due to impacts on school fees and nutrition. Therefore, we will work on disaster preparedness plans to prevent and reduce risk of landslides.\nChildren continue to be victims of violence, exploitation, and abuse. We will improve our protection of vulnerable children through influencing policy makers and community leaders, and by creating effective systems to eliminate abuse, neglect, exploitation, and all other forms of violence.\nWhile parents of newborns have recently recognized the importance of obtaining birth certificates to ensure their child's rights to education and citizenship, they may have missed this opportunity for their older children. We will work with community leaders to assist these parents in accessing this essential resource for all of their children.\nChildren and youth are often ignored in community meetings, and their voices and opinions are considered inconsequential. We will form community groups where children and youth acquire and practice the skills of debate, communication, negotiation, and group decision-making.", 0], ["25 community-based organizations were trained in income-generating projects such as pig raising, rice cultivation, and fish farming.

But rainfall has decreased and farmers are seeking other forms of income generation. Therefore, we will work to increase farmers\u2019 income through more productive and sustainable agriculture systems like irrigation and poultry and livestock raising.\nDrought, deforestation, and poverty have left farmers and their families facing food shortages for up to six months every year. We will partner with the World Food Program and UNICEF to create a food for work program. Residents will build and repair roads and water pipes, and be paid with food for their families.\nMany children under five years old do not have access to a balanced diet. Therefore we will focus on nutrition education for families, emphasizing the importance of protein and vegetables for children during their early years.\nChildren in remote areas often miss out on immunizations because there are not enough healthcare workers to travel to these hard-to-reach places. So we will train additional community health volunteers who will be able to serve these children and families.\nFamilies need education about malaria prevention and treatment. We plan to strengthen healthcare education at the household level, where knowledge is lacking.\nWater is scarce in the area, and people depend on streams for drinking water and irrigation. However, these streams dry up after the rainy season, and children have to travel up to three miles to find water. We will focus on creating additional water sources that provide children with this essential resource.\nDiarrhea and acute respiratory infections are prevalent for children under five because of unsafe water and poor hygiene. Very few families have a latrine. We will concentrate on training children and adults about personal hygiene, and will work to improve sanitation in the village.\nChildren stop attending school after the primary level because middle and secondary schools are too far from the community. We will work with the Education Department to provide transportation and funding so students can continue their schooling.\nStudents who drop out of school are more likely to become involved in dangerous and antisocial activities. Therefore, we will provide vocational skills training for youth so they can find employment and earn income.\nAlthough many parents recognize the importance of early childhood education, there are no preschools in the area and young children are therefore not prepared for primary school. So we will open preschools, provide supplies and teaching aids, and train teachers and management committees.\nSeveral parents are not educated and do not see the benefits of education for their children in terms of income and livelihood. We will work with the active local Parent Teacher Association (PTA) as they spread the word to others about the importance of education.\nDuring the rainy season, landslides can quickly wipe out farmers' fields, which are planted on steep hillsides. These landslides cause families to lose their access to food and income, which affects the well-being of children due to impacts on school fees and nutrition. Therefore, we will work on disaster preparedness plans to prevent and reduce risk of landslides.\nChildren continue to be victims of violence, exploitation, and abuse. We will improve our protection of vulnerable children through influencing policy makers and community leaders, and by creating effective systems to eliminate abuse, neglect, exploitation, and all other forms of violence.\nWhile parents of newborns have recently recognized the importance of obtaining birth certificates to ensure their child's rights to education and citizenship, they may have missed this opportunity for their older children. We will work with community leaders to assist these parents in accessing this essential resource for all of their children.\nChildren and youth are often ignored in community meetings, and their voices and opinions are considered inconsequential. We will form community groups where children and youth acquire and practice the skills of debate, communication, negotiation, and group decision-making.</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">1</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0006/#activity+details/6", "type": "text", "id": "text0006"}, {"bite": "The largest <span class=\"hbheader\">sectors</span> is <span class=\"hbvalue\">Other</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">1</span> reports followed by <span class=\"hbvalue\">Agriculture|Disaster Prevention and Preparedness|Economic Recovery and Development|Education|Protection</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">1</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0006/#sector+list/10", "type": "text", "id": "text0006"}, {"bite": "The largest <span class=\"hbheader\">donors</span> is <span class=\"hbvalue\"></span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">10</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0007/#org+donor+list/26", "type": "text", "id": "text0007"}, {"bite": "The largest <span class=\"hbheader\">organization</span> is <span class=\"hbvalue\">World Concern</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">8</span> reports followed by <span class=\"hbvalue\">World Vision US, Inc.</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">2</span> reports.", "priority": 8, "subtype": "main", "uniqueID": "text0008/#org+implementing+name/0", "type": "text", "id": "text0008"}, {"bite": "<span class=\"hbheader\">target_project_reach</span>:<span class=\"hbvalue\">79387</span>", "priority": 8, "subtype": "topline figure", "uniqueID": "text0012/#targeted+num/17", "type": "text", "id": "text0012"}, {"bite": "<span class=\"hbheader\">actual_project_reach</span>:<span class=\"hbvalue\">0</span>", "priority": 8, "subtype": "topline figure", "uniqueID": "text0012/#reached+num/18", "type": "text", "id": "text0012"}, {"bite": "<span class=\"hbheader\">target_groups</span>:<span class=\"hbvalue\">0</span>", "priority": 8, "subtype": "topline figure", "uniqueID": "text0012/#targeted+description/20", "type": "text", "id": "text0012"}]}}, "hxl": 1}]}
