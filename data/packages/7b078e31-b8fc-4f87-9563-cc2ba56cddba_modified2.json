The transition strategy for the interim six month period foresees the continuation of ongoing ECD activities with some variations on program timeframes between new and older Dioceses leading to changes in frequency of home visits. The transition strategy is grounded on continued learning, innovation and piloting that will enable key stakeholders to manage and own the ECD Program while at the same time providing continued services to caregivers and their children. - Integrating nutrition assessment with ECD through ongoing health services (growth monitoring), home visitations, care giver support and learning group sessions will enable the Program to attain scale and maintain effectiveness. Detecting the early on-set of malnutrition together with referral; treatment and counseling can avert and reduce the incidence of wasting (Marasmus) and edematous malnutrition (kwashiorkor) averting and reducing the negative longer term consequences. - The caregiver peer-to-peer home visit approach is a small pilot that will be learned from, adopted and scaled up - Continued participatory discussions and consultation are expected to lead to increased participation and involvement and ultimately to self-management and ownership.", null], ["Throughout Africa, The Hunger Project\u2019s Epicenter Strategy mobilizes the population of a cluster of villages within a 10km radius to create an \u201cepicenter,\u201d or a center from which community-led development emanates to the surrounding areas.

By providing tuition, uniforms, books and school supplies, WHI provides the essentials for children to receive an education. In addition, parents are taught how to provide for their families through vocational and community trainings, helping them to be better farmers or small business owners, improved community members, and enhanced parents. The Child Sponsorship Program is one way that WHI invests in the lives of children in need.

These young people are now using their skills to support themselves and their families.\nTo improve household income, we partnered with Vision Fund to train 415 community members to start small businesses.\nIn order to prevent malaria, we trained 103 households in malaria prevention methods such as using bed nets and eliminating areas of standing water where mosquitoes breed.\nWe trained 30 community volunteers in HIV testing and 28 caregivers in helping people living with HIV and AIDS maintain their antiretroviral treatments.\n1,263 community members attended our sessions on hygiene practices, proper water handling and storage, solid waste management, and handwashing to improve community sanitation. We also provided water sanitation packets for all families through a partnership with Proctor and Gamble.\nStudents benefited from a better learning environment when we installed sanitary latrines in schools and taught children about handwashing and personal hygiene.\n35 local emergency relief committee members learned about disaster mitigation and reviewed the community's disaster preparedness plan.</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">1</span> reports followed by <span class=\"hbvalue\">15 new savings groups provided interest-earning savings accounts and small, affordable loans for people who don\u2019t have access to traditional banking services, empowering them to plan for the future, start businesses, and meet their children\u2019s basic needs.\nIn order to improve productivity and increase food supplies we trained 16 farmers in livestock management and disease control.\nAs a result of the training we provided to mothers' groups, 38 children were identified as malnourished and referred to the local clinic for a nutrition intervention.\nMore than 4,000 children received Vitamin A when we partnered with the Ministry of Health on child health campaigns in remote villages. Vitamin A protects against blindness and disease.\nWe built a new hospital and rural health center to replace a dilapidated health clinic that was missing a roof, water, electricity, supplies, and medicines.\n4,227 people gained access to clean water when we constructed 16 new borehole wells.
