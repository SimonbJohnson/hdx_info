Hundreds of thousands in Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cambodia are living healthier, more productive lives because of clean water. WHI responds to the water crisis in three ways: \n\n\nDrilling wells: Clean water wells not only improve one's quality of life, they prolong it. WHI operates well-drilling rigs in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are run by crews made up of local engineers. The teams drill wells in communities, schools, hospitals and other public institutions that lack a clean water source, and then train local leaders to maintain the wells and keep clean water flowing long after drilling is done. One well brings clean water to approximately 550 people. \n\n\nBuilding latrines: Most people don't realize how important a toilet is -- yet clean toilets play a huge role in preventing the spread of bacteria and disease. In many of the same communities, schools and hospitals where wells are drilled, WHI builds latrines. Local materials are used to build the facilities, and community leaders are trained to maintain them. \n\n\nEducating communities: Clean water changes lives, but to maximize its impact, it must be accompanied by sanitation and hygiene education. WHI teaches children and families how to keep themselves and their communities healthy and clean through hand-washing, regular bathing, oral hygiene, safe food preparation, trash pick-up and more.", 1], ["According to UNICEF, Early Childhood Development (ECD) is the key to a full and productive life for a child. In fact, in the first years of life, children establish the cognitive, emotional and social foundation upon which they can build their futures. Sadly, country-wide estimates indicate that only 10% of children in Sierra Leone are enrolled in pre-primary school or nursery programs. Pre-school programs are undervalued by parents and unavailable in most low-resource communities, and at-home preparation for entrance into primary school is rare. As a result, a large number of children lack essential school readiness skills upon entering primary school, limiting their ability to reach their full potential.\n\nThat is what World Hope is hoping to change through the ECD project, getting children ready for school so they can harness the full opportunities afforded by an education and empowering their parents and caregivers to enable them.

Unfortunately, a widespread cultural misunderstanding of disability, complicated by the lack of health care or other public support services, makes children living with physical and mental disabilities some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable children.\n\nExtensive poverty, traditional beliefs, and illiteracy often leave the affected children rejected or abandoned and seen as a curse on their family.\n\nThat\u2019s where WHI\u2019s Enable the Children (ETC) program comes in.

WHI operates well-drilling rigs in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are run by crews made up of local engineers. The teams drill wells in communities, schools, hospitals and other public institutions that lack a clean water source, and then train local leaders to maintain the wells and keep clean water flowing long after drilling is done. One well brings clean water to approximately 550 people. \n\n\nBuilding latrines: Most people don't realize how important a toilet is -- yet clean toilets play a huge role in preventing the spread of bacteria and disease. In many of the same communities, schools and hospitals where wells are drilled, WHI builds latrines. Local materials are used to build the facilities, and community leaders are trained to maintain them. \n\n\nEducating communities: Clean water changes lives, but to maximize its impact, it must be accompanied by sanitation and hygiene education.

In fact, in the first years of life, children establish the cognitive, emotional and social foundation upon which they can build their futures.

Pre-school programs are undervalued by parents and unavailable in most low-resource communities, and at-home preparation for entrance into primary school is rare. As a result, a large number of children lack essential school readiness skills upon entering primary school, limiting their ability to reach their full potential.\n\nThat is what World Hope is hoping to change through the ECD project, getting children ready for school so they can harness the full opportunities afforded by an education and empowering their parents and caregivers to enable them.
