The main objective is to improve the nutritional status of 1000-days women and children, those in the period between conception and a child\u2019s second birthday. A combination of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions will be implemented throughout 40 of Nepal\u2019s 75 districts. The five main program areas are maternal and child nutrition; maternal, newborn, and child health services; family planning; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and agriculture/homestead food production (HFP).  Furthermore, social and behavior change communication (SBCC) approaches adapted to each location, a focus on gender and social inclusion (GESI), and routine monitoring, evaluation, and research for learning and programmatic strengthening provide the basis for all Suaahara II interventions.

Social behavior change strategies will support increasing women\u2019s household decision making.\n\u2022  Accelerate the rollout of the Multi-sector Nutrition Plan (MSNP) through strengthened local governance.
