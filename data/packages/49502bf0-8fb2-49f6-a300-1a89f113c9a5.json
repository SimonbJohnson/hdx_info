This way, children and adolescents have experienced in the activities situations where they can respect others and show solidarity to each other. The Community Reading of the Bible has enabled us to have a better knowledge of the children and of Jesus Christ\u2019s love. Some children have showed a better behavior and have had a better school performance due to the educators\u2019 encouragement and to the spiritual nourishment.14.25 social educators and partners participated effectively in meetings and capacity building workshops about Child Protection 15.70 Mothers and/or caregivers were invited to take part in lectures and community meetings in several partner agencies (schools, day care centers, associations). The areas explored were  child labor,  good quality of education to develop the children\u2019s cognitive skills, and other crosscutting themes that were approached throughout the year. \n16.The participation of the families in Project activities happened in bigger events (bounce backs). There was also more participation in sponsorship in programming itinerant activities. The sponsorship team has monitored the children who didn\u2019t take part in the activities through home visits17.We worked towards the strengthening and expansion of partnerships with organizations and institutions that are committed to develop actions to benefit the children. 18.There are currently seven (7) educators in the Programme who understand the details of the workflows and operations of the sponsorship system and four (4) educators of the programming activities, with a total of eleven (11) educators to work with all the children in the Programme.</span> with <span
