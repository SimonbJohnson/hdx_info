that is long term (15-20 years), holistic, focused on children, and seeks to enable their families, local communities and partners to address the underlying causes of poverty. These root causes are not just lack of access to the basic necessities of life like water, food or health care, but also include inequities like gender or ethnic discrimination, or abusive practices like exploitation or domestic violence that affect a child\u2019s well-being.</span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">6</span> reports followed by <span class=\"hbvalue\">Throughout Africa, The Hunger Project\u2019s Epicenter Strategy mobilizes the population of a cluster of villages within a 10km radius to create an \u201cepicenter,\u201d or a center from which community-led development emanates to the surrounding areas. Through this fully integrated development strategy, community members establish and manage their own programs to address food security, nutrition, health, education, microfinance, water and sanitation. Epicenters follow four distinct phases over a period of about five to eight years on a path toward to sustainable self-reliance.  \n \nAbehenease-Akawani Epicenter is currently in Phase 3, during which the epicenter community shores up the progress that it has made since its inception, while beginning to plan for a transition to self-reliance. Trainings are led by community-based animators, and epicenter committees manage each program, including budget oversight and leadership transitions. The epicenter strengthens its partnerships, including solidifying and creating an even more powerful partnership with local government. Abehenease-Akawani epicenter serves 9 villages with a total population of 4268 women, men and children in the Kwaebibirem district of <a href=\"http://www.thp.org/ghana/\">Ghana</a>.

For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers\u2019 cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs. </span> with <span class=\"hbvalue\">26</span> reports followed by <span class=\"hbvalue\">This Program is still in the planning phase.
