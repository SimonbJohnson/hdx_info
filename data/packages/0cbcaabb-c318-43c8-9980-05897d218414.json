Also aquatic organisms living in the infected area are affected and may die. Specifically in larger catchment areas, nutrients have been building-up in the sediment from years of urban and agricultural pollution. Because of this, algal blooms will not easily be halted and solutions which are not chemical-based are scarce. LG Sonic, based in the Netherlands, is one of the few companies in the world, that has a viable solution to effectively reduce algal blooms without negatively affecting the aquatic ecosystem. The ultrasonic based solution that LG Sonic has invented has already been used successfully on smaller reservoirs (between 20 and 200 Ha of surface area) since 2011 and is currently the only technology present that seems to have a potential to be upscaled to even larger reservoirs and lakes. To do so however, LG Sonic will need to radically change the current design of the technology to make it fit for a wider range of waterbodies. They intent to do so, though this Partners For Water program, which will allow them to upscale their technology to solve this tremendous environmental problem globally. By developing the MPC-MultiBuoy (MPC-MBS), LG Sonic will have access to a wider range of lakes and reservoirs for which their current MPC-Buoy technology is not fit, such as:\u2022\tLakes with a large surface area, which would otherwise require the installation of hundreds of MPC-Buoy systems. \u2022\tLakes with a complicated shape or islands that would also require the installation of too many systems.\u2022\tLakes and reservoirs that are remote or outside an area with cellular reception.\u2022\tLakes and reservoirs in which the technology cannot be protected against theft or vandalism, either because they lie within an urban area or too far outside of it. LG Sonic is already advanced in the design of the MPC-MBS, and would like to use this program to speed-up the development of the system and facilitate a pilot of the technology. For the location of the pilot, we have chosen Dubai, mainly because the potential of upscaling after the pilot is very high here and the negotiations about the upscaling is already advanced. Another important reason is the presence of the local partner in Dubai Globe2Cloud (G2C), who is designing the communication method and can provide local support to the pilot installation. In Dubai Municipality lies the Al Marmoom Desert Conservation Reserve. This is the first unfenced nature conservation reserve in the United Arab Emirates. It is located in the desert area of Saih Al Salam in the emirate of Dubai and comprises some 10% of the total land area of the emirate, including the extensive man-made desert wetlands: the Al Qudra Lakes. Unfortunately, these lakes are filled with harmful algal blooms due to high phosphate levels.In 2018, LG Sonic has successfully demonstrated their MPC-Buoy technology in lake no. 44 in Dubai. The technology has reduced their phycocyanin levels (Blue-green algae) with 70% in this lake. Because of this, Dubai Municipality is eager to install the technology in their other 48 lakes as well.However, with the current MPC-Buoy technology, this would not be feasible, for the following reasons:\u2022\tThe lakes have an odd shape and include many islands, which would require the installation of too many MPC-Buoy systems to effectively treat the entire surface area. \u2022\tThe MPC-Buoy is completely based on the water, requiring a boat for maintenance activities.

To this power station, multiple ultrasonic transmitters and sensors can be connected that can be placed at strategic locations in the lake. To do so however, LG Sonic and G2C need to restructure and redesign the ultrasonic transmitters and programs, develop an optimal communication protocol and design the on-shore power system.
